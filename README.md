# 2-Bar-Grip

Intro:
The 2 Bar Grip is a tool that can be used to stabilize [metal rods](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Everbilt-3-16-in-x-3-ft-Plain-Steel-Solid-Round-Rod-0403/332733428) (diameter: 4.76 mm (3/16 in), length: 91.44 cm (3 ft)) at 3.5 cm apart for use with the balance beam motor task. The tool has both a 5mm and a 7mm hook in order to hang from the inside of either a 75Jag Cage (Allentown) or a N10 Mouse cage (Ancare).

## Hardware

All files were printed using a Prusa i3 MKS3, using OVERTURE PLA Plus (PLA+) 1.75mm Professional Toughness filament.\
Nozzle used was 0.6mm.\
Painter's tape was put on print bed to increase print adhesion with bed.
* Make sure tape is completely flat
* No gaps between tape pieces
* If tape tears when removing print, replace with new piece

### Cleaning
To clean the 2 Bar Grip for reuse between experiments, scrub all surfaces vigorously using a sponge and dish soap.

## Software

All parts sliced (aka rendered) using PrusaSlicer 2.9.2
